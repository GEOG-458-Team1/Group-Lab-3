    "Lastly, according to the [Canada 2011 Census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Canadian_Census), the term \"urban areas\" was changed to \"population centre\". This is due to the belief that there isn't a strict division between the definition of urban and rural but instead there are multiple settlement patterns that exist. Although there is a change in terminology, the definition of population centre remains the same as:\n",
    ">A population of at least 1,000 people where the density is no fewer than 400 persons per km<sup>2</sup>\n",
